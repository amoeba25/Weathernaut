## Learningss


### Tech stack
These are my learnings from making this weather app. I was initially going to pick a bit complicated stack with - Reactquery, Typescript and Recoild but it was adding complexity for a simple application I am thinking of building. I will try to inculcate TS once I am done with making it in JS, that way, I will get a bit more idea on where and how to make changes (because TS has a lot of features). <br>
Current tech stack - React and Tailwind
